## Biweekly_Challenge:

This python script was written using vscode. The purpose of this script is to collect input from a user and intelligently display the results. The script prompts for a users name, age and gender, and prints out the user's name and age according to the gender input. It also calculates the user date of birth from the age and prints it out, stating the age group the user belongs to, the age of the user a decade ago, and the user's age in the next 50 years per decade interval.

## Biweekly_Challenge_2:
